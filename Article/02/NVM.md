NvRam Manager provides many services for NvM user , and I will focus on the services commonly used :  
- Read block
- Write block
- Restore defaults
- Invalidate Nv Block
- Erase Block
- Read All
- Write All

There are 3 executors running in NvM layer to process the service request from NvM user:<br />
- Task
- Main Job
- Sub Job <br />

And they are scheduled in cascade:<br />

## NvM - Task 
NvM user requests service by push service to a queue.
Task takes responsibility to pop service from queue and starts the job to process the service request  .<br />
![Main Task State](NVM_State_Diagram-MainTaskState.png)<br />
If the request is to process only one block ï¼Œthe **Normal Job** will be executed ,otherwise the **Multi block job** will be executed.

## NvM - Job 
### Normal Priority Job <br />
